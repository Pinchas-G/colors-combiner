# colors-combiner

This is a small project where users can mix two colors by dragging and dropping them into a large circle. The large circle will then display the resulting color, which is a blend of the two colors mixed together.

## Introduction

Initially, this project started as an implementation request from a friend, who asked me to integrate the following code snippet into their project. I decided to take it further and enhance it with additional styling and functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

## Features

- **Color Mixing**: Users can drag and drop two colors into a large circle.
- **Result Display**: The large circle displays the resulting color from blending the two colors.
- **Two Interaction Methods**:
  1. **Color Picker**: Users can select colors using a color picker and then drag them into the circle.
  2. **Drag and Drop**: Users can directly drag colors from a palette and drop them into the circle.
